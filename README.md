It is fundamentally important to capture, parse, and analyze network packets. Although several off-the-shelf systems such as TCPDUMP and WIRESHARK are readily available for packet capturing, parsing, and basic analyzing, designing and implementing customized packet analysis systems are still common practices in the field of network security. Through this project, students will
1.	Gain fundamental skills to capture network packets by directly programming with packet-capture library (pcap). 
2.	Enhance the knowledge of network protocols and practice with packet parsing. 
3.	Performing simple statistics over the captured packets to profile the network situation.
